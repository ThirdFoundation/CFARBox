This is some HACKED TOGETHER code to run a few very simple operations during a locked-room puzzle for 12-20 participants.  Essentially, it's a place for people to grab hints, check answers, and occasionally feel uneasy about the robot.

Please don't judge me.  Had to get it done, very little time, very little sleep.  I only know like 10% of the rules to begin with, and I broke like twenty of those.
